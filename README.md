The `bom forecast` sensor platform uses the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au) as a source for forecast meteorological data.

- Each sensor will be given the `device_id` of "bom [optionalname] friendlyname units"
- A name is optional but if multiple BOM weather stations are used a name will be required.
- The sensor checks for new data every minute, starting 30 minutes after the timestamp of the most recent data as the data is updated every half-hour.

To add the BOM weather observation to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: bom_forecast
    product_id: IDV10450
    name: Melbourne
    forecast_days: 3
    rest_of_today: True
    friendly: True
    mode: friendly
    friendly_state_format: '{max}, {summary}'
    text_if_no_value: '-'
    monitored_conditions:
      - 'max'
      - 'min'
      - 'chance_of_rain'
      - 'possible_rainfall'
      - 'summary'
      - 'detailed_summary'
```

To get the Product ID for any BOM city:
- Go to [this](http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/observations/map.shtml) website and search for "City Forecast", or "Town Forecast".
- The Product ID for your city will be in the left most column, and will look like "IDV10450"

Configuration variables:

- **product_id** (*Optional*): The Product ID string as identified from the BOM website.  If not given, defaults to the closest city.
- **name** (*Optional*): The name you would like to give to the weather forecast.
- **forecast_days** (*Optional*): The number of days of forecast you would like, maximum is 6. If not given, defaults to 6.
- **mode** (*Optional*): Specifies which sensors to create. 
    'friendly' will only create one sensor per day of forecast, and will have all the forecast information as sensor attributes\n
    'separate' will create separate sensors for each value for each day as returned by the BOM data. 
    'all' returns both the friendly sensors and each individual sensor as well. 
    Default = 'friendly'.
- **rest_of_today** (*Optional*): Would you like to create a sensor for the forecast for the rest of today. Defaults to true.
- **friendly_state_format** (*Optional*): Friendly state format allows you to format the state of your forecast sensors when in friendly mode. For example, '{min} to {max}, {summary}' will display the state as '10 to 25, Cloudy'. Defaults to '{summary}'.
- **text_if_no_value** (*Optional*): Defines the text to be returned for a sensor if the BOM has not data available. Defaults to 'n/a'.
- **monitored_conditions** (*Required*): A list of the conditions to monitor.
